## Overview of our application and features

Currently, we have five fundamental features in our project:

1. **Job Application Tracking:** Keep an organized record of job applications, including a wish list, application history, and the ability to add prospective offers.

2. **Project Management Integration:** Extend the application's functionality beyond job applications to create dynamic boards and columns for project management.

3. **Customization:** Customize columns, titles, descriptions, and workflow stages to match your unique needs.

4. **Efficient Updates:** Easily track progress with detailed updates, stage assignments, and a drag-and-drop feature for seamless task management.

5. **Data Security:** Ensure your information is stored securely with data persistence in a database, accessible for the long term.

## Technical Overview
- This React-based web application backed by Flask backend operates within the user's web browser, offering essential functionalities, including:
    - **User Authentication:** Upon login, the backend application generates and securely stores tokens locally on the user's device to facilitate secure and seamless user sessions.
    - **Access Control:** Authenticated users enjoy access to a range of pages and features, ensuring a tailored and controlled user experience.
    - **Backend Infrastructure:** The application is dependent on a Flask server to handle diverse user requests. This server interfaces with a MongoDB database to retrieve and store data, guaranteeing smooth functionality and persistent data management.
    - Together, these components ensure the application is secure and loaded with features, providing users with a dependable and personalized experience.

|---|---|
| react | ^18.2.0 |
| react-redux | ^8.0.5 |
| react-router-dom | ^6.19.0 |
| @testing-library/react | ^13.4.0 |
| uuid | ^9.0.0 |

| Flask | 2.2.5 |
| Flask-Cors | 4.0.0 |
mongoengine | 0.27.0 |
| flask-mongoengine | 1.0.0 |
| pytest | 3.0.5 |
| pytest-cov | 2.4.0 |
| Jinja2 | 3.1.2 |
| python-dotenv | 1.0.0 |
| wheel | 0.36.2 |

## Installation

### Requirements:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (recommended >= 3.8)
- [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) (Latest version  23.3.1 used as of 11/27/2023)
- [npm](https://nodejs.org/en) (Latest version 21.2.0 used as of 11/27/2023)

### Development tools 
Recommended and used by the developers:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv)
- [Mongo Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass)

### Strongly Recommended:

- A terminal environment capable of handling bash scripts.

To install all required packages, while within the context of the project root directory, run:

```
./setup.sh
```
This will handle all npm and pip package installations required for both the front and backend.

In case you are running python3, run:

```
./setup_py3.sh
```

*If the script says "command not found" or something similar, run chmod +x ./setup.sh. This grants the script execution privileges. Depending on your setup, this may occur for the boot_dockerless files, amongst others. The same command will fix the issue.*

## Getting Started:
### Boot:
To run a testing environment, run:
```
./startup.sh
```
This will run flask and npm simultaneously, booting both the front and backend. Note - npm takes substantially longer to boot compared to flask.
### Shutdown:
To ensure that flask is no longer occupying a port, run:
```
./shutdown.sh
```
This will search for any active process containing "flask" and kill the process.

## Hosting the Database.
### Local MongoDB:
1. Download [MongoDB Community Server](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)
2. Follow the [Installion Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/server/install/)
3. In  ```app.py```  set  ```'host'```  string to  ```'localhost'```
4. Run the local database: 
``` 
mongod 
```
* Recommended: Use a GUI such as [Studio 3T](https://studio3t.com/download/) to more easily interact with the database


### Hosted database with MongoDB Atlas:
1. [Create account](https://account.mongodb.com/account/register) for MongoDB
 
** ___If current MongoDB Atlas owner adds your username/password to the cluster, skip to step 4___ **

2. Follow MongoDB Atlas [Setup Guide](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/) to create a database collection for hosting applications
3. Create a ```.env``` file using .env_example file in the backend and add the mongodb username and password
```
MONGODB_USERNAME="<MongoDB Atlas cluster username>"
MONGODB_PWD="<MongoDB Atlas cluster password>"
```
4. In  ```app.py```  set  ```MONGODB_SECTIONS```  string to your MongoDB Atlas connection string like
```
app.config["MONGODB_SETTINGS"] = {
    "host": f"mongodb+srv://{app.config["MONGODB_USERNAME"]}:{app.config["MONGODB_PWD"]}@your_cluster.mongodb.net/your_db_name",
}
```
5. For testing through CI to function as expected, repository secrets will need to be added through the settings. Create individual secrets with the following keys/values:
```
MONGO_USER: <MongoDB Atlas cluster username>
MONGO_PASS: <MongoDB Atlas cluster password>
```

## Setting up the Extension

Here we will guide you on how to setup the Job tracking Application extension. The setup of extension may vary little from browser to browser. We will see how to load the extension in Google Chrome.

### Step 1: Setting up required files

These are the files required but not limited t in setting the extension:

1. **manifest.json:** This file describes your extension, its permissions, and how it interacts with web pages. 
2. **popup.html:** simple HTML file that will be displayed when the extension icon is clicked.
3. **popup.js:** JavaScript file to handle the button click from the extension and initiate the interaction with the web page.
4. **background.js:** A background script to handle the communication between the popup and python flask server.

### Step 2:

After you have setup all these files according to your implementation, load this extension in the browser. 

- **For Chrome:** Open the Extension Management page (**`chrome://extensions/`**), enable "Developer mode," and click "Load unpacked." Select the directory containing your extension files.
- **For Firefox:** Open the Add-ons Manager (*`about:addons`*), click the gear icon, and choose "Debug Add-ons." Click "Load Temporary Add-on" and select any file in your extension's directory.

You are all set! The extension can be used to either add the job you've recently applied for or to function as a reminders board, allowing you to save your job postings on any job board. This way, you can revisit them later for future applications.
